[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/cwbaker/unittest-cpp.svg?branch=forge-v0.0.x)](https://travis-ci.com/cwbaker/unittest-cpp)

This is a fork of UnitTest++ that adds support for building using [Forge](https://github.com/cwbaker/forge).

Changes are made in the *forge-v0.0.x* branch (the default branch for this fork).  The changes will be rebased onto the *master* branch when changes are pulled from upstream at [UnitTest++](https://github.com/unittest-cpp/unittest-cpp).
