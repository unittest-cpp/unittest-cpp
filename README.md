UnitTest++
===========

UnitTest++ is a lightweight unit testing framework for C++. It was designed to do test-driven development on a wide variety of platforms. Simplicity, portability, speed, and small footprint are all very important aspects of UnitTest++. UnitTest++ is mostly standard C++ and makes minimal use of advanced library and language features, which means it should be easily portable to just about any platform. Out of the box, the following platforms are supported:

* Windows
* Linux
* Mac OS X
* VxWorks 5.5

Documentation
--------------
The full documentation for building and using UnitTest++ can be found on the [GitHub wiki page](https://github.com/unittest-cpp/unittest-cpp/wiki). The contents of this wiki are also included as a git submodule under the `docs` folder, so version-specific Markdown documentation is always available along with the download.

Pre-requisites
---------------
While there are currently some bundled automake files, UnitTest++ is primarily built and supported using [CMake](http://cmake.org).
